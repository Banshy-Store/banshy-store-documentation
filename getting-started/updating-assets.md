- Changelogs provide details about updates, fixes, and new features.

### Avoiding update errors

- In Keymaster, log in and re-download the updated version of your asset.

### Quick checklist
- Backup existing files
- Download latest package
- Replace entire asset (avoid partial patches unless instructed)
- Restart your server
