# How to get your DLCs

DLCs (Downloadable Content) add features or files to a main script. Only the purchasing account has access.

## Download your DLCs
1. Go to the script page for the relevant asset (same store as the purchase).
2. Sign in with the account that purchased the asset.
3. Open the "DLC" or "Add-ons" section.
4. Download the available files.

## Best practices
- Make sure you're logged in with the correct account (the one that made the purchase).
- If a DLC seems missing, check your orders then contact support with proof of purchase.
