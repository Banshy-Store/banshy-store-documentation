# About Banshy

![Banshy](assets/banshy1200.webp)

I am a solo engineer building ultra premium, hand crafted scripts for FiveM. I joined the GTA scene recently with a simple goal: deliver production ready resources that server owners can trust.

## What I stand for
- Quality first - clean, readable code with strong performance and security
- Inter framework support - ESX, QBCore, and QBOX bridges maintained
- Real playtesting - every release is tested with a curated group of players
- Clear operations - straightforward installation, sane defaults, and robust validations

## How I build
- Design and prototyping in small iterations
- Implementation with explicit configuration and zero hard dependencies where possible
- Internal QA with logs, assertions, and anti abuse controls
- External playtests to validate gameplay, UX, and edge cases

## Support and updates
- I provide documentation focused on installation and real world operations
- Fast iteration on bug fixes and minor improvements
- See [Support](support.md) for how to request help effectively
