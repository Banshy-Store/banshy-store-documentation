# About Banshy

![Banshy](../assets/banshy128.webp)

I’m Banshy, a solo engineer building ultra‑premium, hand‑crafted FiveM scripts. New to the GTA scene but obsessed with quality, I focus on:

- Inter‑framework support (ESX, QBCore, QBOX) with robust bridges
- Performance, security, and clean code
- Real playtesting with a curated group of players before release
- Clear installation and long‑term maintainability (i18n, webhooks, integrations)

My goal is simple: deliver scripts that server owners can trust in production.
