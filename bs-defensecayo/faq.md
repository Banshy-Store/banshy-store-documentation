# FAQ

**Does this require ESX?**  ESX is recommended. Standalone is possible if you disable framework‑specific features.

**Can I disable specific zones?**  Yes. Set each zone’s `enabled` flag to `false`.

**How do I tone down the difficulty?**  Reduce unit counts, accuracy, and armor; remove RPG/sniper loadouts; increase respawn cooldown.

**Do guards always shoot first?**  By default they engage within the configured radius. Lower `engageRadius` or require line‑of‑sight depending on your configuration.

**Is this compatible with heists or events?**  Yes. It is designed for RP events; you can temporarily boost units and heavy support, then revert.

**Any known conflicts?**  Avoid overlapping spawners or AI managers in the same zones, and ensure map/props resources don’t block spawn points.
