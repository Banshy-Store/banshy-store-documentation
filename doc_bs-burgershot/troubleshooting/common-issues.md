# Common Issues

- Items not found: check `BSConfig.ItemsMap` names and inventory backend.
- Target zones off: adjust `BSConfig.TargetZones` and `BSConfig.Points`.
- Billing on QB: ensure `qb-billing` is installed or use `direct` mode.
- Society not credited on QB/QBOX: ensure `qb-management`/`qbx-management` present; otherwise it's disabled.
