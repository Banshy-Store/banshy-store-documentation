## How to get your DLCs

Use the same account that purchased the asset to access DLCs.

DLCs (Downloadable Content) are additional files or features that enhance a main asset. For example, inventory systems may provide DLCs that unlock extra capabilities. Only the original purchaser of an asset can access its DLCs.

### Where to find and download DLCs
1. Visit the store product page of the purchased asset.
2. Log in with the same account used to purchase the asset.
3. Look for a "DLC" or "Add-ons" section on the product page.
4. Download the available DLCs from the provided links.

### Notes and tips
- DLC visibility is tied to the purchaser account. Ensure you are logged in with the correct account.
- If you believe a DLC is missing, verify your purchase history first, then contact support with your order details.
