Welcome to the Banshy Store documentation portal. I’m Banshy a solo engineer and passionate newcomer to the GTA/FiveM scene, building ultra‑premium scripts to give the community rock‑solid, polished, and future‑proof experiences.

What to expect from these scripts:
- Inter‑framework by design: ESX, QBCore, and QBOX bridges included
- Hand‑crafted code: clean, readable, with performance and security in mind
- Battle‑tested with a curated group of playtesters before each release
- Focused on operability: clear installation, sane defaults, robust validations
- Long‑term: maintainable configs, i18n, and integration points (inventory, billing, webhooks)

## Docs by script
- BS-BurgerShot: `doc_bs-burgershot/`
- bs-cardealer: `doc_bs-cardealer/`
- bs-bikeshop: `doc_bs-bikeshop/`

Use the summary to navigate: start with the generic docs, then explore our scripts.
